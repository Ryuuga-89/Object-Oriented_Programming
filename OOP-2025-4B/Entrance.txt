Good morning, everyone.

The Science Tokyo community is pleased to welcome students, parents, family members,
staff, and friends to the 2025 Spring Entrance Ceremony for bachelor’s program students. 
We are here to celebrate all the new students joining us today.
We also want to acknowledge your guardians and families, and express our gratitude for 
the time and effort they have dedicated to your lives.

On this special day, we extend a warm welcome to the 1,471 students entering the bachelor's 
degree program, including the transfer students joining us from other institutions. I am 
sure all of you have been waiting eagerly for this day to come, and finally, it is here.
Congratulations！
